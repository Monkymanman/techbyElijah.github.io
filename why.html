                Cats are so much better then dogs they arent loud and needy like dogs are. They can be independent and can be very loving while some dogs are really aggresive. house cats are also less dangurous then some house dogs. in conclusion dogs are stinky losers and cats are way cooler then them. just look at how cool the cat below this text is!
